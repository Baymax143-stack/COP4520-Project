## Project Topic: Integrating Parallel Computation of Nash Equilibria into N-Player Role-Playing Games
When we consider its definition, a role-playing game (RPG) is a game in which participants assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting; its definition, however, can be extended by analysis of randomness or unpredictability in the game. In this project, we wil conduct the following steps:

1. Delve into how we can define a role-playing game by stochastic randomness, referencing that a stochastic game is denoted as a game where "the play proceeds by steps from position to position, according to transition probabilities controlled jointly by two players." [^1]
2. Observe the processes required to calculate equilibrium given the dynamic nature of the game, where a set of choices conducted by each player not only affects the amount and type of payoff another player receives but affects the environment they are interacting within.
3. Determine how parallel structures and algorithms can be implemented in a virtual simulation of *Dungeons and Dragons* (DnD) to support calculation of Nash Equilibrium throughout each state of the game and assist action-choice selection by the program to act similarly to the role of a *Dungeon Master* (DM).
4. Analyze if implementation of parallel structures and algorithms affects performative randomness conducted by the participant interacting with the program, and how efficiency achieved by the program is affected when more than 2 players are introduced in the simulation.

## Recorded Updates:

### Update: 03/25/2022
*As a note, I recently changed my topic (in the previous Sunday) with the original project group members leaving this group for their own reasons. As a result, I switched my topic to accommodate for the limited time left for the overall project and that I am now a one-person team. Please refer to the below images as proof of the approval for change in topic, and I hope it is understandable as to why there is not much progress recorded by the deadline for midterm progress check*
