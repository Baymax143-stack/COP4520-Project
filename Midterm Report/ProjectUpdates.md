## Recorded Updates:

### Update: 03/25/2022
*As a note, I recently changed my topic (in the previous Sunday) with the original project group members leaving this group for their own reasons. As a result, I switched my topic to accommodate for the limited time left for the overall project and that I am now a one-person team. Please refer to the below images as proof of the approval for change in topic, and I hope it is understandable as to why there is not much progress recorded by the deadline for midterm progress check*
